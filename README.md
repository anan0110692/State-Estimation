# State-Estimation
This is a state estimation project, such that we take the output of a certain system, and feeded it to the Kalman filter to estimate the internal state of that system.

 In this project we have simulated the following non linear system:

Then, we feeded the output(z) to the Kalman filter to estimate the internal state of that system(x).
